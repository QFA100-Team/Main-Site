                WorldFlight 2022 is the third itteration of the QFA100 Team!
                <br><br><b><u>Some brief history:</u></b><br>
                Linn M began flying the QFA100 Callsign during WorldFlight 2019 alone, and sparked the idea for a virtual group of pilots, flying one callsign, around the world, for one whole week.
                <br>During 2020, Linn approached a number of dedicated VATPAC and VATSIM Members with the proposal to fly a group callsign, and during 2020 and 2021, QFA100 was involved in all legs during WorldFlight! <br>
                In 2022, we are delighted to bring back the QFA100 Team for our third year of operation!<br>
                The team is looking forward to being involved in WorldFlight 2022!<br><br>
                Check out the WorldFlight 2022 Route <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/477414012489826324/1005309795806478446/2022_Route_Final.jpg" target="_blank">here</a>!.
